This stitching pipeline is curtesy of https://github.com/aartighatkesar/Image-Mosaicing

Although this code does not have a final blending step and many times lines are visible where frames are stitched.
But overall it is a good soln which gives a good opportunity to learn.


Modyfied the code a bit, also changed opencv version, installed contrib to run this soln successfully.

Details on how to run:

python3 image_mosaic.py

results are stored in /results folder
it is fun to see successive output images to see how its stitching based rendering progresses.
